# Data-Science-And-Statistics-Practical
This repository contains Data Science practical experiments completed using Python and Jupyter Notebook. Each experiment focuses on important concepts used in data handling, analysis, and machine learning

‚úÖ List of Experiments

1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Acquisition using Pandas
We learn how to load data from files like CSV or Excel and view it using pandas.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Central Tendency (Mean, Median, Mode)
We calculate important statistical values that help to understand data properly.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Basics of DataFrames
We create and handle DataFrames which are used to store and process data in a table format.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Missing Value Treatment
We find missing data and fix it by removing or replacing the empty values.

5Ô∏è‚É£ NumPy Array Creation
We create arrays using NumPy and perform mathematical operations on them.

6Ô∏è‚É£ Data Visualization using Matplotlib
We draw graphs like bar chart, line chart, scatter plot to understand data visually.

7Ô∏è‚É£ Simple Linear Regression
We create a simple prediction model that uses a straight line to predict future values.

8Ô∏è‚É£ Logistic Regression
We build a model that predicts categories such as yes/no or pass/fail.

9Ô∏è‚É£ K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)
We classify data by checking the nearest neighbors in the dataset.

1Ô∏è‚É£0Ô∏è‚É£ Support Vector Machine (SVM)
We make a classification model that finds the best line or boundary to separate data points.

1Ô∏è‚É£1Ô∏è‚É£ Decision Tree Classifier
We build a tree-like structure that helps to make decisions step by step.

1Ô∏è‚É£2Ô∏è‚É£ Random Forest Classifier
We create a strong prediction model by combining many decision trees.
