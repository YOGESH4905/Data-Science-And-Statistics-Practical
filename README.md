# Data-Science-And-Statistics-Practical

This repository contains Data Science practical experiments completed using Python and Jupyter Notebook. Each experiment focuses on important concepts used in data handling, analysis, and machine learning

✅ List of Experiments

1️⃣ Data Acquisition using Pandas We learn how to load data from files like CSV or Excel and view it using pandas.

2️⃣ Central Tendency (Mean, Median, Mode) We calculate important statistical values that help to understand data properly.

3️⃣ Basics of DataFrames We create and handle DataFrames which are used to store and process data in a table format.

4️⃣ Missing Value Treatment We find missing data and fix it by removing or replacing the empty values.

5️⃣ NumPy Array Creation We create arrays using NumPy and perform mathematical operations on them.

6️⃣ Data Visualization using Matplotlib We draw graphs like bar chart, line chart, scatter plot to understand data visually.

7️⃣ Simple Linear Regression We create a simple prediction model that uses a straight line to predict future values.

8️⃣ Logistic Regression We build a model that predicts categories such as yes/no or pass/fail.

9️⃣ K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) We classify data by checking the nearest neighbors in the dataset.

1️⃣0️⃣ Support Vector Machine (SVM) We make a classification model that finds the best line or boundary to separate data points.

1️⃣1️⃣ Decision Tree Classifier We build a tree-like structure that helps to make decisions step by step.

1️⃣2️⃣ Random Forest Classifier We create a strong prediction model by combining many decision trees.
